## About me
I had career break about 6 years (maternity leave). I couldn’t work as a programmer in office.  I opened a business. It was an online store of wooden toys (http://woodentoys.by – owner have already changed design).  I developed a web site, found suppliers and opened a store. The store was sold when my second daughter was born. Then I helped to support websites (f.e. http://u-style.by – The Persona Image Studio “For you Style” has closed 1 year ago, http://zabelaweddings.it ) and design http://gammaeffekt.by It was just a freelance job.
